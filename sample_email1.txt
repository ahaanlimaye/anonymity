Elizabeth,
I need to update several of our faculty and teaching staff on the changes in the English departmentâ€™s process for assigning teaching schedules to Graduate Teaching Assistants. As you know, the old process gave preference to more senior TAs, which led to numerous complaints of unfairness and an overall lack of clarity. Starting next semester, the English department will transition to a new rolling system that divides TAs into four groups alphabetically and ensures each group will be given first preference of teaching times once every two academic years.
This change will go into effect starting January 5, 2015. In your message I would like you to outline the new process and explain the reasons why we need to make this change. Please provide contact information for the assistant department head in case anyone needs further information. Oh, and this information will also need to be copied to the appropriate associate dean.
I appreciate your help with this.
